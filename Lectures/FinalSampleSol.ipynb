    "A satellite in a circular geostationary orbit  above the Earth's surface (meaning it has the same angular velocity as the Earth) explodes in to three pieces of equal mass. One piece remains in a circular orbit at the same height as the satellite's orbit after the collision, but the velocity of this piece is in the opposite direction to the velocity of the satellite before the explosion.  After the explosion the second piece falls from rest in a straight line directly to the Earth. The third piece has an initial velocity in the same direction as the original direction of the satellite, but now has a different magnitude of velocity.
